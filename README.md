# Eduk8me Clocks

There are two clocks available, one is a [plain old clock](clock.html) and the other is a [countdown clock](countdown.html).

These clocks were written with the help of ChatGPT. The countdown clock was written as an easy way to bring in a countdown clock into [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) as a browser source. 

When using it in OBS, a good starting size for the browser source is 1920x300. The size can be adjusted as necessary to fit.

# Usage

Mousing over the bottom right corner will show a settings gear to modify aspects of each calendar. The settings are stored in the url, so once you have the clock or countdown set up the way you want, save a bookmark to the page.
